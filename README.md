# IXIS-Challenge
R code

This is my exploratory and analyzation code for the IXIS Data Challenge. My code gets the job done, but there is certainly room for increased efficiency. Data frames were cleaned, manipulated, combined, and analyzed. My goals after writing this code are to increase familiarity with certain packages, including openxlsx, and to create reusable code structures for future projects.
